​​Responsible data is:
​​The duty to ensure people’s rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership around the information processes of collection, analysis, storage, presentation and reuse of data, while respecting the values of transparency and openness.  (Responsible Data Forum, working definition, September 2014)
​​
​​A slightly different definition (as will be outlined in some upcoming work by Sonjara/mSTAR) as a balance between 1) responsible data use (e.g., being sure that development organizations actually use the data we collect/that have been collected and shared by others); 2) transparency and accountability (to those we collect data from, to those who fund data collection/use, to the public); and 3) data privacy and security when we are stewarding or using data we have collected.

​​Improving Data Quality in Mobile Community-Based Health Information Systems–Guidelines for Design and Implementation from Measure Evaluation
​​Increasingly, community-based health programs collect data that flow into donor programs and national health information system(s) (HIS). Programs are turning to mobile health (mHealth) technology to address a variety of challenges, including those associated with paper-based reporting systems, such as inefficient filing systems and operational challenges including storage space associated with transporting paper forms and receiving data in a timely manner. Mobile technologies can help programs improve the completeness and accuracy of data, tap the potential for real-time reporting, and strengthen communication and supervisory feedback practices.

### Public bodies regularly releasing personal information by accident in Excel files

​​When officers within public bodies release FOI information that they think they have anonymised, they import personally identifiable information and an attempt is made to summarise it in anonymous form, often using pivot tables or charts. We have seen a variety of public bodies, including councils, the police, and parts of the NHS, accidentally release personal information in this way.
